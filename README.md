# Installing the icons in your project
[Download fonts and stylesheets](https://github.com/DanCanetti/wp-plugin-icons/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Copy the font files to your fonts/webfonts directory
- Copy the CSS files (To save loading times I reccommend only copying the minified file) to your css directory
- Include the css file in the ```<head>``` of your project
- You're should be ready to use the icons now
- **Don't forget to apply the ```aria-label="Plugin Name"``` if you're using the icon on it's own**
